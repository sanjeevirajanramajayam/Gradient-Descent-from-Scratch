## üñº Project Overview

This project visualizes the **gradient descent algorithm** in 2D using Python, NumPy, SymPy, and Matplotlib.

**Key highlights:**

- Animated **ball moving along the curve** following gradient descent steps.
- **Interactive slider** to choose the starting \(x\)-position.
- Shows **descent steps** with a connecting line for clarity.

## üéØ Learning Goals

- Understand how **gradient descent works** to minimize a function.
- Observe how the **starting position affects convergence**.
- Build intuition for **learning rate** and step sizes in optimization.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **2D line plot visualization** for clear observation of the descent.
- **Animated ball and step lines** showing each update in real-time.
- **Interactive slider** to change the initial starting point.
- Implements symbolic derivatives using **SymPy** for automatic gradient computation.
